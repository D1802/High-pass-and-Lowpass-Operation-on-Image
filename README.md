# High-pass-and-Lowpass-Operation-on-Image
An image is first converted into grey scale from RGB. Then using a Gaussian filter, low pass and high pass filtered image is synthesized and visualized. High pass response is just the complementary of low pass response as shown in the screenshot. MATLAB inbuilt fft function is used for spectral extraction.
